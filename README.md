# Replication files for 'The Emergence of Party-Based Political Careers in the UK, 1801-1918'

This repository contains all necessary data and code to replicate tables and figures in 'The Emergence of Party-Based Political Careers in the UK, 1801-1918' (Cox and Nowacki, forthcoming).

To run the replication in one go, we have added a `makefile` that runs all scripts in the necessary order. To execute, run

```
make R
```

from the repository's root directory. The `makefile` also comments on what scripts are responsible for what output.

# File Tree

There are three folders in the repository:
* `code` contains all necessary `R` scripts.
* `data` contains all original data.
* `output` contains all data and output generated by running scripts (divided into tables, figures and modified data)
